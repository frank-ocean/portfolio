## Work Experience
**Researcher @ Predictive Analytics by Integrated Intelligence, LLC., Seoul, Republic of Korea  (_ar. 2023 – Jan. 2024_)**
- Applied Data Science techniques to analyze market trends, processed large datasets to extract actionable insights, and
developed predictive models to support corporate decision-making and strategy development.
- Enhanced article visibility by applying SEO best practices, including keyword optimization and analytics-driven topic
selection. Achieved approximately 30% traffic increase and a 20% boost in ad revenue by strategically aligning high-
performing content with advertising placements.
- Provided insightful AI and finance industry updates to 300-400 visitors per day, aimed at facilitating informed
investment decisions.

**Engineering Intern  @ Korea Data Agency Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea (_Jun. 2021 – Sep. 2021_)**
- Built a holistic, data-driven framework that empowered small-scale producers to enhance market positioning,
attract diverse consumer segments—including the foreign market—and unlock the potential of digital marketing to
revitalize a centuries-old industry with modern approaches.
- Processed 317,313 reviews for 112 traditional Korean liquor products, leveraging NLP tools (Selenium, Mecab, TF-
IDF, Word2Vec) to extract key consumer insights and identify untapped market opportunities.
- Designed a personalized recommendation system using logistic regression and cosine similarity, offering tailored
product suggestions to users while promoting lesser-known varieties to expand consumer awareness.logistic regression
to classify positive and negative reviews, extracting key positive and negative words.
- Developed a market segmentation strategy targeting foreign consumers, analyzing demand potential among 2.46
million foreigners in Korea and K-culture enthusiasts worldwide. Highlighted opportunities by drawing parallels
between Makgeolli and similar traditional beverages globally, such as Bolivia’s Chica.
- Conducted cultural and market analysis to support product differentiation, visualizing factors such as acidity, sugar
content, and ideal food pairings to position products as premium offerings.
